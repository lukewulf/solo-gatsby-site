Paying homage to [The Marvelous Wondergraph](https://www.digitalindy.org/digital/collection/tcm/id/787), a children's toy that is now over 100 years old.  The Wondergraph
project aims to capture how minute differences in radial measurements can compound to create vastly different designs.  Each Wondergraph is an invitation to the intersection 
of math and art, and are meant as a launching point to more generative designs.  

The Wondergraph project is built through Javascript and Processing, each NFT is 1 of 1.
